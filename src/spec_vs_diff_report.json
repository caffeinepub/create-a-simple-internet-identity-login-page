  "summary": "HomePage.tsx was updated to a deeper ocean/underwater gradient theme and retains the header navigation buttons wired to the existing onNavigate callback. The diff is truncated around the feature box section, so the exact bottom 3-box content/CTA labels and responsive layout requirements cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add a bottom section on the Home page containing 3 boxes side-by-side (responsive) with the exact feature titles, descriptions, and CTA labels provided by the user; each CTA must navigate to the appropriate existing page.",
      "reason": "The HomePage.tsx diff is truncated before the feature boxes are shown, so there is not enough evidence to confirm the exact required titles/descriptions/CTA labels, the responsive 3-across-to-stacked layout behavior, and that each CTA navigates correctly to onNavigate('map'|'calculate'|'comment').",
