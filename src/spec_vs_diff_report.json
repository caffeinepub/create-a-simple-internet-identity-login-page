  "summary": "Diff appears to implement the requested Home page feature-box update, Home background swap, and major Fishing Zone enhancements (baby-blue theming tokens, city/district search dataset, and marker-capable map support). However, some acceptance-criteria details (notably explicit UI labeling of estimated vs fetched metrics, and explicit simultaneous red+yellow marker rendering behavior) are not fully evidenced in the provided truncated diff. Several unrelated page/theme/config changes also appear to have been made beyond the requested scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Compute and present the Coral Reef Health Index on the Fishing Zone page based specifically on temperature, pH, oxygen level, and turbidity (using fetched values when available, otherwise clearly labeled estimates), and ensure the index calculation uses these four inputs consistently.",
      "reason": "While the code shows CHI computation using the four inputs, the diff snippet does not show UI output that displays each metric value along with whether it was estimated (per-metric labeling). The SearchResult type includes estimated flags, but assignment/rendering is not visible in the truncated excerpt.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "On the Fishing Zone map, highlight at least one location representing \"more fish presence\" for the searched sea/ocean using a yellow pointer, derived from the computed fish availability/condition for the searched sea/ocean and shown simultaneously with the red searched-location pointer.",
      "reason": "The diff shows props added for a fishHotspot and indicates hotspot calculation begins for seas/oceans, but the truncated excerpts do not show (a) how the hotspot is derived from fish availability/condition, and (b) that the map actually renders both red and yellow markers simultaneously.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Update the Fishing Zone map rendering from a static image-only display to a marker-capable map component (using existing bundled map assets/components) so it can render the required red and yellow pointers at latitude/longitude coordinates without introducing new backend services.",
      "reason": "ContinentalMap now accepts markerLocation and fishHotspot and includes a lat/lng-to-SVG conversion, but the provided truncation does not include the actual rendering of red/yellow pointers/markers, so marker rendering cannot be fully verified from the excerpt alone.",
