  "summary": "ICP starter app with Motoko backend canister and React+Vite+Tailwind frontend (Internet Identity auth, shadcn/ui, example pages). HomePage remains ocean/underwater themed but now requires baby-blue coral reef background imagery and a Home feature-box layout where the Fishing Zone box is placed beside the Comments box. Fishing Zone page should use a baby-blue theme, expand search/display to include sea/ocean plus city and district, highlight searched locations with a red pointer, compute Coral Reef Health Index from temperature/pH/oxygen/turbidity, and highlight locations with higher fish presence on the same map using a yellow pointer.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Architecture split into Motoko backend canister + React/Vite frontend; frontend interacts via generated declarations (backend.did.*) and actor hooks.",
    "Authentication uses Internet Identity; frontend maintains authenticated vs unauthenticated routing/pages (LoginPage, AuthedLandingPage).",
    "UI layer is based on Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, with custom ESLint rules to enforce project constraints.",
    "Build/deploy scaffolding includes an ICP-oriented build template (Dockerfile, deploy.sh, canister.yaml) plus scripts to resize/prune generated images.",
    "Frontend includes a public HomePage in addition to LoginPage and AuthedLandingPage, with routing updated accordingly.",
    "Frontend adds a StorageClient abstraction for client-side persistence (e.g., localStorage/session storage access).",
    "Frontend routing/page set expanded beyond initial Home/Login/AuthedLanding to include additional example pages (Calculate, Comments, Google Map, Profile).",
    "Frontend includes bundled geography datasets and a ContinentalMap UI component, along with a generated labeled world map image asset, to support map/geo visualizations without relying solely on external map providers.",
    "Fishing Zone page requires defining data sources/logic for coral health index per sea/ocean and cyclone/flood possibility; current scaffold does not include these datasets/APIs yet.",
    "If an 'original and real map' is required, confirm whether to use existing Google Map integration (GoogleMapPage) or bundled map datasets (ContinentalMap) as the primary map renderer on the Fishing Zone page."
