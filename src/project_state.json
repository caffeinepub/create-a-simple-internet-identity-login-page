  "architectural_notes": [
    "Architecture split into Motoko backend canister + React/Vite frontend; frontend interacts via generated declarations (backend.did.*) and actor hooks.",
    "Authentication uses Internet Identity; frontend maintains authenticated vs unauthenticated routing/pages (LoginPage, AuthedLandingPage).",
    "UI layer is based on Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, with custom ESLint rules to enforce project constraints.",
    "Build/deploy scaffolding includes an ICP-oriented build template (Dockerfile, deploy.sh, canister.yaml) plus scripts to resize/prune generated images.",
    "Frontend includes a public HomePage in addition to LoginPage and AuthedLandingPage, with routing updated accordingly.",
    "Frontend adds a StorageClient abstraction for client-side persistence (e.g., localStorage/session storage access).",
    "Frontend routing/page set expanded beyond initial Home/Login/AuthedLanding to include additional example pages (Calculate, Comments, Google Map, Profile).",
    "Frontend includes bundled geography datasets and a ContinentalMap UI component, along with a generated labeled world map image asset, to support map/geo visualizations without relying solely on external map providers."
