  "summary": "Diff implements baby-blue styling on HomePage and extends Fishing Zone search logic to include states with updated error messaging. Map-related changes add markerLocation support to ContinentalMap, but the Fishing Zone page’s actual marker rendering behavior and removal of the yellow fish hotspot pointer cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "In Fishing Zone, highlight the searched location on the map using a red marker only for all supported search types (sea, ocean, city, district, state), and remove the yellow fish hotspot pointer behavior from the Fishing Zone experience.",
      "reason": "While ContinentalMap now accepts a markerLocation prop and the FishingZonePage computes lat/lng for search types, the provided truncated diff does not show (a) FishingZonePage actually passing markerLocation to the map, (b) enforcement that exactly one red marker is shown after search, or (c) explicit removal of any existing yellow/fish hotspot marker behavior or related subtitle/description text.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on switching Home + Fishing Zone pages to a baby-blue theme and adjusting Fishing Zone marker behavior; updating the map component’s base image and background styling is not explicitly requested (though marker support is related).",
